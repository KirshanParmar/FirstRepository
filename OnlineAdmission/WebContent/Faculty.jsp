     <p>The need of new approaches in agriculture teachings aimed to reduce yield losses in crops due to insect pests, plant diseases and weeds was felt at the time of up gradation of former Agriculture
     College to Sindh Agriculture University, Tandojam in 1977. This was eventually translated into the establishment of the Faculty of Crop protection in July, 1987. The teachings at this Faculty coordinate
     the work of Entomology, Plant Pathology. Weed science and other Plant Protection components for imparting the technical know-how of producucing healthy crops and addressing the day to day problems of 
     farming community in the field of Crop Protection as a whole. The Faculty achieves this task through its three departments viz. Entomology, Plant Panthology and Plant Protection; offering course work 
     leading to graduate and postgraduate degrees with special reference to identification and management of newly observed as well as the traditional insect pests, weeds and diseases of crops caused by fungi,
     bacteria, viruses and nematodes. At present, the Faculty of Crop Protection offers a 4-year B.Sc (Agri.) Hons., M.Sc (Agri). Hons. and PhD degree program in Entomology, Plant Pathology and Plant Protection.
